# Tomo Break
Tomo break is the Pomodoro Technique, with a gaming twist. The point of the game is to reward players for taking breaks, so they may form good habits. The user must try to reach the recommended number of breaks in order to reach success. There is also a visual representation of how many breaks the user has taken. Whenever the user takes a break, a tomato is added to the 'collection box', allowing the user to gain an awareness of how many tomatoes (or breaks) it takes to complete their tasks.
